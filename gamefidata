-- Assuming there is a table called 'gamefi_wallets' in the database with relevant data

-- Step 1: Connect to the database (replace 'your_database' with your actual database name)
USE your_database;

-- Step 2: Fetch the number of wallets
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_wallets
FROM gamefi_wallets;

-- Step 3: Fetch the total transaction volume
SELECT SUM(transaction_volume) AS total_volume
FROM gamefi_wallets;

-- Step 4: Fetch the average wallet size
SELECT AVG(wallet_size) AS avg_wallet_size
FROM gamefi_wallets;

-- Step 5: Fetch other variables (add or modify these queries based on your data and requirements)
SELECT
    MAX(wallet_size) AS max_wallet_size,
    MIN(wallet_size) AS min_wallet_size,
    SUM(total_holding) AS total_holding,
    AVG(transaction_value) AS avg_transaction_value
FROM gamefi_wallets;
